The multiplication of two integers works by adding one integer to itself repeatedly the number of times indicated by the other integer, taking into account the signs to determine the final positive or negative result.
For example, multiplying 3 × -4 works by adding 3 to itself 4 times and then applying the negative sign, giving -12.
